# real_estate_analysis
This is my attempt to the final project of the Data Analyst Career Track from the 365 Data Science learning platform. The majority of the work is original except for some of the plots where I copied their code with some minor modifications. This project is purely for learning purposes. The project background and objective can be found from their [website](https://learn.365datascience.com/projects/real-estate-market-analysis-with-python/). For convenience we copy them below.

**Background:** The real estate market is a complex and dynamic entity of great interest for professionals in the field, investors, policymakers, and data analysts that wish to thoroughly understand the market conditions and customer behavior and make informed decisions. In our Real Estate Market Analysis with Python project, the client—a leading company in the industry—has collected data on properties and their customers and wishes you to help them with the real estate analysis. 

**Project Objective:** This Real Estate Market Analysis with Python project aims for you to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the real estate property data, thereby generating meaningful insights about property transactions and customer profiles.
